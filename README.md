AWS Resource Lister Script
A simple bash script to list resources across various AWS services for a specified region.

Prerequisites üìã

AWS Command Line Interface (CLI): The script relies on the AWS CLI to interact with your AWS account. If you don't have it, you can find installation instructions here.

Bash
aws configure
How to Run üöÄ
Make the script executable.
From your terminal, run the following command to give the script permission to execute:

Bash
chmod +x aws_resource_list.sh
Run the script.
Execute the script with the desired AWS region and service name as arguments.

Syntax:
